    "## Summary: how to build a covariance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider `INPUT` = `FITOPT000_MUOPT000.FITRES`. Based on this choice, we can calculate the different contributions to the covariance matrix. The full covariance `_COVd.txt` is then given by $$C = C_{fit} + C_{stat} + C_{dupl} + C_{FITOPTS} + C_{MUOPTS}$$\n",

    "### SALT2 fit covariance $C_{fit}$\n",

    "1. from each line in `INPUT` (which corresponds to an observation of a supernova event, not necessarily unique events) build a blockdiagonal matrix from `COV_x0_x1` etc variables: $$\\sigma^2_{SNe, survey} = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} \\Delta x_0^2 & \\sigma_{x_0, x_1} & \\sigma_{x_0, c} \\\\ \\sigma_{x_0, x_1} & \\Delta x_1^2 & \\sigma_{c, x_1} \\\\ \\sigma_{x_0, c} & \\sigma_{c, x_1} & \\Delta c^2\\end{array}\\right)$$\n",
    "2. transform this matrix to the $(m_B, x_1, c)$ space:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{Cov}(m_B, x_1, c) = J \\cdot \\mathbb{Cov}(x_0, x_1, c) \\cdot J^T$$  using $m_B = -2.5 \\cdot \\log_{10}x_0 + c$ and thus $J = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "\\frac{-2.5}{x_0\\ln 10} & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)$\n",
    "3. construct a block diagonal $3N \\times 3N$ matrix from the $3 \\times 3$ $\\sigma_{SNe}^2$ blocks for each SNe $$C_{SALT2} = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}  f_1 \\cdot \\sigma_{SNe, 1}^2 & & 0 \\\\ & \\ddots & \\\\ 0 & & f_N \\cdot \\sigma_{SNe, N}^2\\end{array}\\right)$$ where in Pantheon+ $f$ is a survey-dependent scaling to account for selection effects (see below) which we set to be $f=1$.\n",
    "4. For some SNe, the $\\sigma_{SNe}^2$ block matrix is not positive semi-definit. In these cases, the respective SNe is dropped from the final covariance $C$ as well as from the `INPUT` file.\n",

    "\n",
    "Brout et al. 2022 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8e04/pdf) consider a statistical covariance $C_{stat}$ calculated by $$C_{stat} = \\begin{cases} f \\cdot \\sigma_{meas}^2 + &\\sigma_{scat}^2 + \\sigma_{gray}^2 + \\sigma_{lens}^2 + \\sigma_z^2 + \\sigma_{vpec}^2 & \\text{same SNe and same survey} \\\\ &\\sigma_{scat}^2 + \\sigma_{gray}^2 + \\sigma_{lens}^2 + \\sigma_z^2 + \\sigma_{vpec}^2 & \\text{same SNe, different surveys} \\\\ 0 & & \\text{other off-diagonal entries}\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "(Equations (3), (4) and (5)). The different terms are given as follows:\n",
    "- $f$ is a survey-dependent scaling to account for selection effects\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{meas}^2$ gives measurement uncertainty of SALT2 light-curve fit parameters\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{scat}^2$ describes modelled intrinsic brightness fluctuations\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{gray}^2$ is constant (added to $\\sigma_{scat}^2$ to give $\\sigma_{floor}^2$), determined after the BBC fitting process\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{lens} = 0.055 z$\n",
    "- $\\sigma_z^2$ as given in the `.FITRES` files \n",
    "- $\\sigma_{vpec}^2$ as given in the `.FITRES` files   \n",
    "  \n",
    "In our case, the measurement uncertainty term $f \\cdot \\sigma_{meas}^2$ is given by $C_{fit}$. $\\sigma_{vpec}^2$ is not relevant as we are not considering any peculiar velocities.  \n",
    "The detailed treatment of $f, \\sigma_{scat}^2, \\sigma_{gray}^2$ in Brout et al. 2022 is performed under specific cosmological assumptions as they are infered from the bias correction. This is why we don't consider them in our analysis but adopt $f=1, \\sigma_{floor}^2 = \\sigma_{scat}^2 + \\sigma_{gray}^2 = 0$.\n",
    "From the uncertainties accociated with lensing and redshift, we obtain $$C_{stat}^{ij} = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",

For a given SNe, the $\\overline{m_{B}}, \\overline{{x}_{1}}, \\overline{c}$ have the same values for all surveys. Additionally, $0.102mag$ is added to all off-diagonal $(m_B, m_B)$ components, as this is the standard deviation of the differences of duplicated SNe according to Scolnic et al. 2022 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03863.pdf). Again, all blocks for individual SNe (of size $3\\nu \\times 3 \\nu$ for $\\nu$ surveys) are combined to a block-diagonal $3N \\times 3N$ matrix:\n",

    "In our case we choose `df2`=`INPUT` and vary `df1` across the other `FITOPT` files. We assume `df1[VARNAME_MUREF]`=`df2[VARNAME_MU]` which reduces `diff` to `scale * (df1[VARNAME_MU]- df2[VARNAME_MU])`. Furthermore, we want to consider $m_B, x_1, c$ instead of $\\mu$ only. Thus, our calculation is as follows:\n",
    "$$C_{FITOPTS} = \\sum\\limits_\\psi \\delta_\\psi \\cdot \\delta_\\psi^T$$\n",
    "where $\\psi$ varies across the different `FITOPT` files. $\\delta_\\psi$ is defined as $\\delta_\\psi = \\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\vdots\\\\m_{B, i}\\\\ x_{1, i}\\\\ c_i\\\\ \\vdots\\end{array}\\right)_{\\psi} - \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\vdots\\\\m_{B, i}\\\\ x_{1, i}\\\\ c_i\\\\ \\vdots\\end{array}\\right)_{INPUT}\\right) \\cdot \\sigma_\\psi$ with $i$ enumerating the SNe in `INPUT`.\n",
