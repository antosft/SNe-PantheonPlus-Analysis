    "## Summary: how to build a covariance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "First, decide on how to calculate the `_input.txt`:\n",
    "- mean of all `FITOPTS`\n",
    "- `FITOPT000_MUOPT000.FITRES`  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The latter works better and makes more sense if we consider both `FITOPTS` and `MUOPTS` in the systematic covariance. Thus we choose `INPUT` = `FITOPT000_MUOPT000.FITRES`.  For duplicated SNe in these files we take the mean over all surveys.  \n",
    "Secondly, we can calculate the different contributions to the covariance matrix. The full covariance `_COVd.txt` is then given by $$\\Sigma = \\Sigma_{fit} + \\Sigma_{stat} + \\Sigma_{dupl} + \\Sigma_{FITOPTS} + \\Sigma_{MUOPTS}$$\n",

    "1. from each line in `INPUT` (which corresponds to an observation of a supernova event, not necessarily unique events) build a blockdiagonal matrix from `COV_x0_x1` etc variables: $$\\sigma^2_{SNe, survey} = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} \\Delta x_0^2 & \\sigma_{x_0, x_1} & \\sigma_{x_0, c} \\\\ \\sigma_{x_0, x_1} & \\Delta x_1^2 & \\sigma_{c, x_1} \\\\ \\sigma_{x_0, c} & \\sigma_{c, x_1} & \\Delta c^2\\end{array}\\right)$$\n",
    "2. transform this matrix to the $(m_B, x_1, c)$ space:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{Cov}(m_B, x_1, c) = J \\cdot \\mathbb{Cov}(x_0, x_1, c) \\cdot J^T$$  using $m_B = -2.5 \\cdot \\log_{10}x_0 + c$ and thus $J = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",

    "0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)$\n",
    "3. combine covariance matrices of duplicated SNe (observed by $\\nu$ different surveys): from $x_{SNe} = \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\sum\\limits_{surveys} x_{SNe, survey}$ in `INPUT` follows $$\\sigma_{SNe}^2 = \\sum\\limits_{surveys} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{SNe, survey}}{\\nu}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\nu^2} \\sum\\limits_{surveys} \\sigma^2_{SNe, survey}$$\n",

    "The detailed treatment of $f, \\sigma_{scat}^2, \\sigma_{gray}^2$ in Brout et al. 2022 is performed under specific cosmological assumptions as they are infered from the bias correction.
